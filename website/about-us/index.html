            <div class="title">About Us</div>
            <div class="text">CompCo was founded by Brandon Guan, Alan Yi, David, and Midas in 2022. At CompCo, we believe that there is a better way to prepare for college and beyond. A more streamlined, straightforward way for students to enrich themselves and jump out of their comfort zones. As students ourselves, we are passionate about letting competitions become more known and accessible. We focus on a platform where everybody can find the extra-curriculars for them to achieve great things. We’re excited to simplify the process of learning for our users, and connect everybody in a community as we do it.</div>
            <div class="title">What Makes Us Different</div>
            <div class="text">CompCo focuses on the users themselves. We also give our users more agency by allowing our users to host , promote, and discuss competitions they are passionate about. With looking for team functions and forums, we focus on creating a community alongside our users for the betterment of all students. </div>
            <div class="text">
                In addition, CompCo’s team has experienced all the ups and downs of attending competitions as students ourselves. We understand the perspectives of our users and the worries that student life may entail. Our platform and services are adjusted accordingly to these needs.
